# UX Interview & Problem Finding

## Interview Transcript

### Question 1

**Interviewer:** Emma, can you walk me through the last time you felt overwhelmed by your schoolwork — what was happening, and how were you trying to manage everything at that moment?

**Emma:**
It was during university application season. I had two tests, a history essay draft, volleyball practice every day, and scholarship forms due. I remember coming home after practice exhausted, opening my Notes app, and just staring at this long list. Everything felt equally urgent. I didn’t know where to start, so I ended up doing small, easier tasks first just to feel productive — but then I ran out of time for the bigger assignments. That made me more stressed.

### Question 2

**Interviewer:** When you look at your Notes app list, what makes it difficult to decide what to tackle first?

**Emma:**
It’s just a long running list. There’s no real structure beyond maybe a date written next to something. I don’t always estimate how long tasks will take, and I don’t prioritize clearly. So everything feels like it’s shouting at me. There’s no visual difference between something due tomorrow and something due next week unless I carefully read it. When I’m tired, I don’t want to think that hard.

### Question 3

**Interviewer:** After volleyball practice, when your energy is low, how does that affect the way you use your current scheduling tools?

**Emma:**
That’s when things fall apart. I rely on self-discipline to interpret my list. But after practice, I’m mentally drained. I don’t want to reorganize tasks or plan — I just want something to tell me what to do next. Instead, I have to decide for myself. Sometimes I procrastinate because deciding feels harder than doing.

### Question 4

**Interviewer:** Can you tell me about a time when forgetting to log an assignment created stress?

**Emma:**
Yes — once I forgot to add a small reading quiz to my Notes app. I remembered it the night before at 10 PM. I felt panicked and guilty, like I wasn’t organized enough. It wasn’t even a huge assignment, but the surprise made it feel worse. I hate the feeling that something is “floating” outside my system.

### Question 5

**Interviewer:** What does “feeling productive” actually mean to you, and when do you feel unproductive even if you worked hard?

**Emma:**
Productive means making meaningful progress on important things — especially long-term goals like college applications. I feel unproductive when I check off small tasks but avoid the hard, high-impact work. Even if I studied for an hour, if it wasn’t the right thing, I feel behind. I want to feel in control and intentional, not reactive.

## Interview Synthesis

The interview highlights that Emma’s main breakdown occurs during periods of low energy. Her current system depends heavily on self-discipline and manual prioritization. When exhausted, she struggles to decide what to work on next, leading to procrastination or low-impact task selection. Additionally, forgetting to log assignments damages her trust in her system and increases anxiety. She defines productivity as making meaningful progress on important goals, not simply completing small tasks. Overall, Emma needs reduced cognitive load and greater system reliability.
